# WPRUN - Workspace Project Runner

WPRUN is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to run multiple projects within the same workspace or folder efficiently. It provides a sidebar view where you can see all registered projects and execute them with a single click.

## Features

- **Project Auto-Detection**: Reads a `projects.json` file to list available projects automatically.
- **Run Projects Easily**: Provides a sidebar with a "Run" button for each project.
- **Add New Projects**: If `projects.json` is missing, an option to create it is available.

## Requirements

- Your project should have a valid `projects.json` file in the root workspace.

## Configuration

WPRUN reads a `projects.json` file in the root of your workspace. The format is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Backend",
    "path": "./backend",
    "command": "npm run dev"
  },
  {
    "name": "Frontend",
    "path": "./frontend",
    "command": "npm start"
  }
]
```

- **`name`**: The name of the project.
- **`path`**: Relative path to the project folder.
- **`command`**: The command to run the project.

## Usage

1. Open your workspace in VS Code.
2. If `projects.json` does not exist, click the **"Create projects.json"** button in the sidebar.
3. Once the projects are loaded, click **"Run"** next to any project to start it.

## Extension Commands

This extension provides the following commands:

- `wprun.create-json` â†’ Creates a default `projects.json` file.
- `wprun.single-project` â†’ Runs a selected project.
- `wprun.all` â†’ Runs all project.

## Known Issues
